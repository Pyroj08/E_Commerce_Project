## üîÑ Project Workflow
The project follows a standard data analytics workflow, moving from raw data to actionable insights.

1.  **Database Creation:** A relational schema was designed and created in **MySQL** to structure the raw data from multiple CSV files.
2.  **Data Cleaning & ETL:** A **Python** script using **Pandas** and **SQLAlchemy** was developed to connect to the database, clean inconsistencies, handle missing values, and merge the tables into a final, analysis-ready dataset.
3.  **Dashboard Visualization:** The cleaned data was connected to **Power BI** to build a multi-page, interactive dashboard for visual analysis and insight generation.
